Data source `Provisional_Death_Counts_for_Coronavirus_Disease__COVID-19_.csv` is from [https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data)


##Purpose: playing around with COVID data.

##Goals

- [current] compare COVID cases in California to an area around the world that's seeing a decline in cases (South Korea?).
- [current] Attempt to predict California's peak and plateau.
- [completed 2020-04-04] Create a graph of COVID cases in California by date.

![Graph of COVID-19 cases and deaths in California](https://github.com/laynsy/covid/blob/master/covid-19-CA-cases.png "COVID-19 cases and deaths in California")


Considerations: 
1. can you accurately compare two different geographic regions? e.g. are CA and South Korea comparable given population density, area, urban vs rural, etc.
2. May want to include all West Coast states
3. May want to look at USA vs other countries
