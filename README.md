COVID data tracking sandbox

Purpose: playing around with COVID data.
Current goal: create a graph of COVID cases in California by date.
Next goal: compare COVID cases in California to an area around the world that's seeing a decline in cases (South Korea?). Attempt to predict California's peak and plateau.

Considerations: 
1. can you accurately compare two different geographic regions? e.g. are CA and South Korea comparable given population density, area, urban vs rural, etc.
2. May want to include all West Coast states
3. May want to look at USA vs other countries
